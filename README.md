# ⚔️ Loot Hunter (loothunter)

### Your insurance against "I forgot to bonus roll".
**Tailor-made for World of Warcraft Classic: Mists of Pandaria.**

---

## 💀 The Problem
Has this happened to you? The boss dies, and 5 minutes later you realize: **"Nooo, I forgot to use my Bonus Roll!"**. Or worse, you see an item drop and can't remember if it was your BiS or if you should've passed.

**Don't let it happen again.** Loot Hunter is your backup memory; you focus on your rotation, we make sure you never miss a single item.

## 🚀 Why this is a MUST-HAVE
This addon eliminates human error from your raids:

* 🔔 **Real-Time Loot Alerts:** If an item you need drops, the addon will scream (visually) so you don't miss it amidst the chat spam.
* 🧠 **Smart Bonus Roll System:** The addon knows which bosses you care about. If you kill one and have a coin, it triggers a visual and audio alert **impossible to ignore**. Spend your rolls where they actually count!
* ✨ **Independent Lists:** Manage separate lists per character and specialization without mixing anything up.

## ⚡ Key Features
* **🛡️ Set it and Forget it:** You don't need to keep the window open. Build your list, close the UI, and play in peace; the addon works in the background and only pops up when needed.
* **Native Integration:** Add items directly from the Dungeon Journal (**Shift+Click**). Automatically detects your current specialization.
* **Spec Flexibility:** Want the item for your off-spec? Simply **click on the spec name** in your list to manually toggle it instantly.
* **Priority Management:** Mark items as "High Priority" (double click) or "Obtained" (right click) to keep your list clean.
* **Quick Access:** Minimap button to check your list in seconds.
