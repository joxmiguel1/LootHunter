## 💀 The Problem

Has this happened to you? The boss dies, and 5 minutes later you realize: **"Wait, did I roll? SHIT."**. Or worse, you see an item drop and can't remember if it was your BiS or if you should've passed.

**Don't let it happen again.** Loot Hunter is your backup memory; you focus on your rotation, we make sure you never miss a single item.

 

## 🚀 Why this is a MUST-HAVE

This addon eliminates human error from your raids:

*   🔔 **Real-Time Loot Alerts:** If an item you need drops, the addon will scream (visually) so you don't miss it amidst the chat spam.
*   🧠 **Smart Bonus Roll System: (only in pandaria classic)** The addon knows which bosses you care about. If you kill one and have a coin, it triggers a visual and audio alert **impossible to ignore**. Spend your rolls where they actually count!
*   ✨ **Independent Lists:** Manage separate lists per character and specialization without mixing anything up.

 

## ⚡ Key Features

*   **🛍️ Smart Wishlist & Spec Detection:** Build your list by simply **Shift+Clicking** items in the Encounter Journal. The addon automatically tracks items by boss and specialization, with automatic spec detection and multi-language support.
*   **📢 Unmissable Drop Alerts:** Get massive, screen-flashing visual alerts and clear chat notices the moment your tracked items appear in the loot window or are linked in raid chat, so you never miss a drop.
*   **🏆 Complete Outcome Tracking:** Experience dedicated alerts for every outcome: a huge celebration when you **Win**, a lament when someone else gets your item, and a smart **Coin Reminder** (pandaria only) with pre-warning logic so you never forget a bonus roll.
*   **⚙️ Deep Customization & Control:** Configure every alert to your liking, adjust the UI scale for your screen, and manage your per-character lists with quick tools to clear or reset your data.
*   **🛡️ Set it and Forget it:** You don't need to keep the window open. Build your list, close the UI, and play in peace; the addon works in the background and only pops up when needed.
*   **✨ Spec Flexibility:** Want the item for your off-spec? Simply **click on the spec name** in your list to manually toggle it instantly.
*   **🎯 Priority Management:** Mark items as "High Priority" (double click) or "Obtained" (right click) to keep your list clean.
*   **⚡ Quick Access:** Minimap button to check your list in seconds.
*   🌐 **Multilanguage support!** (EN/ES)

 

## 📊 Stats Tab

Track your progress over time:

*   **Current List:** Items tracked, pending, won, and priority counts.
*   **History:** Drops detected, wins, losses, coin reminders, coins used, bosses without your loot, and time since last win.
*   **Sessions:** Select a raid session to review its drops with loot source icons.
*   **Wall of Shame:** Quick summary of most deaths, most revives, and most time dead for the selected session.
*   **Wall of Shame Command:** `/lh_wall` opens a dialog to choose Local, Guild, or Raid.
